jquery before react

React created at facebook
tool that allows them to build a website predictibly
reliable and consistent

able to make the dom, website, etc easy to scale and manage
able to build, mobile apps, virtual reality apps, desktop apps

Some concepts that are very important:
--- Thinking in Components --- 
everything is a lego block and you use different lego blocks together to create a bigger thing.
Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages 

--- One Way Data Flow --- 
With react, data flows from top to bottom and never the other way around.

--- Virtual DOM --- 
DOM means "Document Object Model" for a refresher

Virtual DOM is just a javascript object, that just describes our website and it's current state. We give that object to REACT and the react bot makes changes to the website/dom in the most optimal way possible
Virtual DOM is just a copy of the DOM that fits in a javascript object which is then interpreted and optimized by react
